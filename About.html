<p><b><center><font size = 5>This is a tool that will be useful for managing<br>
		complex and uncertain projects. As seen previous to this page, this<br>
		site will require a login for members. The curent page will allow the <br>
		user to select and upload a file that contains all necessary information<br>
		about any project that a member wants more information about. For example:<br>
		The average length that it will take to complete the project shown by a gantt chart<br>
		that displays the most efficient process. Once the file is uploaded the user <br>
		can then calculate these results. The user will then be <br>
		brought to a page where the resulting gantt chart is shown.
