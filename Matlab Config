If you do:

locate startup.m

You should find the Matlab startup file.

Mine was located: /Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/toolbox/matlab/iofun/+matlab/+internal/+storage/startup.m


In the file you have to tell matlab where it will find all of the files we are going to use for our project.

Add the line:

addpath(genpath('/Users/Michael/Web/SDDProject'))

Where '/Users/Michael/Web/SDDProject' is the path you are using.

So your Matlab startup.m file should look like:






function startup
% STARTUP Startup hook for storage integration.

% Copyright 2014 The MathWorks, Inc.

% File intentionally left blank.

% This is intended to be overridden at runtime with function containing some
% real implementation. This empty implementation allows matlabrc to call us
% safely without needing try/catch or existence checks.

addpath(genpath('/Users/Michael/Web/SDDProject'))

end
